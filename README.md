# bikesharing

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show who is most likely to utilize the bikesharing program as well as where they are most likely to start their ride, where they are likely to end their ride, and whether or not gender impacts this. The Tableau story that I created can be seen here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/bikesharingchallenge_16671578926310/Story1/Bikesharing%20Story#1 "link to dashboard")


## Results

### Top Starting Locations

![Table One](/Resources/Story_1.png) 

The most popular starting locations are lower than midtown in Manhattan. The westside is a more popular starting location than the east side.

### Top Ending Locations

![Table Two](/Resources/Story_2.png) 

The most popular ending locations are similar to the starting locations, but are more evenly spread out throughout NYC.

### Checkout Times for Users

![Table Three](/Resources/Story_3.png) 

Most rides are under 30 minutes. It seems as though people are mostly using the bikes to get from one place to anohter, and not for long bike rides for fun.

### Checkout Times by Gender

![Table Four](/Resources/Story_4.png) 

Men use the citybikes more often and for longer than other genders.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Table Five](/Resources/Story_5.png) 

The most popular times to use the bike during the week are before and after work hours. The weekend times are more evenly spread out. People are most likely using these bikes to commute to and from work which is why these are the most popular times. Without work, the weekends have much more spaced out usage.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

![Table Six](/Resources/Story_6.png) 

Men use the bikes more than women before and after work hours during the week.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

![Table Seven](/Resources/Story_7.png) 

Men subscribers use the bikes more than women subscribers. The most popular days for men to use the bikes are Thursday and Friday.

## Results

### Conclusions 
The conclusions I draw on this data is that bikesharing is much more popular among men and subscribers. The most popular times to ride bikes are during rush hour and this data leaves me to believe that people are using these bikes to commute to work. From this data, I would recommend that citibike try to market more to women in order to increase their profits and market share. Two other visualizations I would create would be the starting and ending locations by gender to see if there are more popular areas that women like to use the bike. Citibike can use this information to effectively market this group of customers.
